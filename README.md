## 🎯 What This Bad Boy Does

This script is basically a **coding wizard** that will:

1. 🔍 **Hunt down Python** (and yell at you if it's missing)
2. 📁 **Spawn a project folder** called `gemini_chatbot`
3. 🏗️ **Build a virtual environment** (because isolation is key!)
4. 🚀 **Auto-activate** that environment like a boss
5. 📦 **Install the magic packages**:
   - `google-generativeai` (the brain)
   - `python-dotenv` (the secret keeper)
6. 📝 **Create `chatbot.py`** with custom AI personality baked in
7. 📝 **Generate `.env`** file (API key goes here!)
8. 📝 **Drop a `requirements.txt`** for the package nerds
9. 📝 **Write a mini README** for your new project

## 🔑 The API Key Adventure

### Option 1: The Boring Way 😴
1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Create account, get key, copy-paste like a normie
3. Edit `.env` file and replace `GEMINI_API_KEY=your_value_here`

### Option 2: The Hacker Challenge 😈
**Want MY API key? Try the commented method in the script!**

Look for this sneaky line in `setup_chatbot.sh`:
```bash
# curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret123" https://chatbot-nitr0x.vercel.app/api/get-env
```

**🎮 CHALLENGE MODE:** Can you guess the real token? 
- Hint: It's NOT `mysecret123` 😏
- Try different combinations and see if you can crack it!
- Format: `Bearer YOUR_GUESS_HERE`
- Good luck, you beautiful hacker! 🕵️‍♂️

*P.S. - If you actually crack it, DM me! I'll be impressed! 👏*

## 🎉 Launch Your Chatbot!

Once the script finishes its magic:

```bash
# Navigate to your shiny new project

# FIRE UP YOUR AI! 🔥
python chatbot.py
```

## 🏗️ What You Get

## 🆘 Troubleshooting (When Things Go Wrong)

sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
# OR
sudo yum install python3 python3-pip
```

### 🔒 "Permission Denied" Drama

- Corporate firewall blocking you? Try a hotspot!

## 🎨 Customize Your AI

Want to change your AI's personality? Edit the `system_instruction` in `chatbot.py`:

```python
system_instruction=(
    "Your custom personality here!"
    "📝 Answer:\n<your format>\n\n📌 Summary:\n<your summary style>"
)
```

## 🎯 Pro Tips

- 💡 **Type 'exit' or 'quit'** to stop chatting
- 🔄 **Virtual environment auto-activates** during setup
- 📝 **Check the generated README** in your project folder
- 🚀 **Script works on Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Arch** - basically any Linux!
